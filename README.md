# Diproxi

A simple mitmproxy script for a certain chat app client.

Diproxi does not download, redistribute, or use any assets from the certain chat app, unlike previous proxies. Instead, it's a simple [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) script that intercepts and redirects requests torwards the chat app's API to your own private server API.
